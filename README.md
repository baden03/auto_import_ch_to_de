# Importing a Used Vehicle from Switzerland to Germany Guide

This guide outlines the steps for importing a used vehicle from Switzerland to Germany, including obtaining export plates and ensuring compliance with customs and vehicle registration regulations in Germany.

## Step 1: Preparing for Export in Switzerland
- **Check Export Requirements**: Confirm any specific requirements for exporting a vehicle from Switzerland.
- **Obtain Export Plates**: To drive the vehicle to Germany, obtain temporary export plates by filling out form ZFO007EXPO202205, available [here](https://www.zh.ch/content/dam/zhweb/bilder-dokumente/themen/mobilitaet/fahrzeuge-kontrollschilder/ZFO007EXPO202205.pdf). These plates are valid until the end of the month and are pro-rated based on how many days are left in the month. They do not need to be returned.
- **Prepare Documents**: Gather all necessary documents, including the vehicle's registration document, bill of sale, and Certificate of Conformity (COC).

## Step 2: Customs Declaration and Import into Germany
- **Notify Customs**: Declare the vehicle at the German border or through a customs broker if declaring post-entry.
-- **Announce the Import**: Upon driving the vehicle over the border from Switzerland to Germany, it's crucial to announce the import at the customs office and request a T1 document. This document is essential for vehicles entering the EU from a non-EU country, allowing them to be transported under customs control within the EU.
--- **Purpose of the T1 Document**: The T1 document serves as a transit document for non-EU goods, ensuring that customs duties are secured until the final destination is reached within the EU. It's a key part of the customs process, allowing for the temporary import and transit of the vehicle.
--- **How to Obtain**: The T1 document can be obtained at the first EU border crossing by declaring the vehicle to customs. Alternatively, a customs broker or logistics company can handle this process on your behalf.
--- **Next Steps**: After obtaining the T1 document, complete the importation process by presenting the vehicle and the document at the customs office in the destination country for clearance and payment of duties and taxes.

- **Pay Import Duties and VAT**: Pay the applicable import duties and VAT. The rates depend on the vehicle's type and value.
- **Obtain Customs Clearance Certificate**: After paying duties and taxes, you'll receive a customs clearance certificate (Zollbescheinigung), required for registration in Germany.

## Step 3: Vehicle Inspection and Registration
- **Technical Inspection**: Have the vehicle inspected by TÃœV or DEKRA to ensure it meets German standards.
- **Insurance**: Obtain German car insurance and receive an insurance confirmation card (eVB number).
- **Registration**: Visit the local vehicle registration office with all documents to complete the registration process.

## Step 4: Final Steps
- **License Plates**: Attach your new German license plates to the vehicle.
- **Environmental Badge**: Obtain an environmental badge if necessary for driving in green zones.

## Additional Tips
- **Research**: Always check the latest regulations on the official German Customs Office (Zoll) and the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) websites.
- **Consider an Agent**: For a smoother process, consider hiring a customs broker or logistics firm to manage the import paperwork.
